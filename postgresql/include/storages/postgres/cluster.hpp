/// @page pg_topology ÂµPg: Cluster topology discovery
///
/// @par Principles of PgaaS role determination
/// - Every host except master is in recovery state from PostgreSQL's POV.
/// This means the check 'select pg_is_in_recovery()' returns `false` for the
/// master and `true` for every other host type.
/// - Some hosts are in sync slave mode. This may be determined by executing
/// 'show synchronous_standby_names' on the master.
/// Slave names returned by this statement are escaped host names where every
/// non-letter and non-digit are replaced with '_'.
///
/// @par PgaaS sync slaves lag
/// By default, PgaaS synchronous slaves are working with 'synchronous_commit'
/// set to 'remote_apply'. Therefore, sync slave may be lagging behind the
/// master and thus is not truly 'synchronous' from the reader's POV,
/// but things may change with time.
///
/// @par Algorithm
/// Every topology update runs for at most 80% of timer update interval, but no
/// less than kMinCheckDuration.
/// Topology check is done in CheckTopology method in two phases:
/// - host check routine which collects relevant info about host states and
/// roles is executed
/// - update routine which actualizes host states is called
/// All the processing is done single-thread, and CheckTopology method is not
/// designed to support multi-threaded calls, so synchronization must be
/// guaranteed outside.
/// Check routine consists of the following stages:
/// - reconnect/wait for connection to become available
/// - availability check (joint with master detection)
/// - sync slaves detection (only for master host)
/// Every stage, including connection to the host, may fail and thus cause
/// reconnect again and again.
/// The core of check process is task multiplexing that allows to simultaneously
/// track different tasks representing different stages.
/// During checks the info about hosts is stored into changes.last_check_type
/// variable.
/// The info is then actualized later during second phase of topology check.
